When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are away from your computer and on someone else's computer. Or if you are
  collaborating with multiple people and want to get the repository out quickly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It may have an affect on your work. For example, if you and a colleague
	are working on the same bit of code, and someone pushes their commit to
	GitHub, if the pull occurs automatically, this may cause you to lose all the work you have been working on.
