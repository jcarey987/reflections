What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git begins the tracking of the files, and logging their versions with a unique
	name. It is a good idea to do this so that you have earlier versions to track
	down any issues you may come across.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

	The staging area differs from the working directory and repository in that it is
	an intermediary inbetween the two. By that, you select the files one by one from
	your working directory to place into the staging area, then you add all of the 
	files in the staging area to the repository.
